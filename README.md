# CENS=Computational Environment for Nuclear Structure
This repository contains several sets of many-body codes developed by Morten Hjorth-Jensen and collaborators. 
The codes amount to several man-years of labor and are made available under the 
GNU  GPL v.3 public license settings. Read carefully the license instructions at https://github.com/ManyBodyPhysics/ManybodyCodes/blob/master/LICENSE and do respect them.
When using the codes included in this library, please cite the github link and the publications and authors listed 
under the various types of many codes.

Presently this library contains 

* Full configuration interaction theory codes, both serial and parallel ones. Cite as:  
T. Engeland and M. Hjorth-Jensen, the Oslo-FCI code, with link to the github address https://github.com/ManyBodyPhysics/ManybodyCodes/

* Many-body perturbation theory codes. Cite as: 
M. Hjorth-Jensen, T.T.S. Kuo, and E. Osnes, Physics Reports 261, 125 (1995) including the above github address
