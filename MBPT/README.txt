These folders contain (parallel versions will made available later, end 2015) codes to renormalize a nucleon-nucleon interaction as well as computing an effective interaction for effective Hilbert spaces typically
used in so-called shell-model calculations in nuclear physics. See the tutorial folder for more information.
