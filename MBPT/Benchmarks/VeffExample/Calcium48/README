Here you find an input file for ca48 with 6 major shells.  The file
bhf.ini defines the inputs to the effective interaction calculations.
The output files for the effective interactions are tailored to the
fp-shell only using the N3LO interaction. The matrix elements for the
N3LO interaction are included here.  The interaction matrix elements
have been generated with the renomalization codes using the inputs
defined in the renorm.ini file.  The effective interaction files are
generated with the bhf.ini file. No executable are listed in this
folder.  Similarly, the interaction matrix element file needs to be
generated since it is too large to store at the github link.  This
folder contains thus only text files.  The codes were compiled using
gfortran version 5.3.0 (Homebrew gcc 5.3.0) on a Macbook PRO 3 GHz
Intel Core i7 on May 25 2016.
